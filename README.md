# ``SMA-Multi-Languages``

This repository contains the code for a simulation of multi-agent systems implemented in various programming languages.
Multi-agent systems (MAS) are computational systems composed of multiple interacting entities, known as agents. 

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of different object-oriented programming (OOP) languages in managing multi-agent simulation. 

The languages studied include : 
* ``C++``
* ``Python``
* ``Java``
* ``Rust``
* ``Ruby``

By comparing the implementations, developers and researchers can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each language for developing MAS.
